# Numbers-Cards-
Use this handy calculator to determine Your Numerological Life Path Number, your Tarot Birth Card Number and your two Tarot Power Cards!

I found the original code to calculate the Life Path Number abandoned at Replit.com.

__CHANGES__

I added a dictionary to store the key/value pairs of each Major Arcana Card.
I developed a simple formula to arrive at the Tarot Birth Card Number <p><b>Tarot Birth Card = (Life Path Number-1)+10</b></p>
<p>I needed to create two more input prompts to call the <b>Life Path Card</b> and the <b>Birth Card</b> Names from the dictionary.</p>

__How to calculate your Life Path Number and your Tarot Birth Card__

The life Path number can be arrived at by adding all the digits of a birth date together and summing the result until you get a single digit.  __UNLESS__ your Life Path Number calculates to an 11, 22 or 33.  In that case, your number will remain as two digits and is considered a _Master Number_.

Your Tarot Birth Card will always sum up to your single Life Path Number.
For example if your Birth Card is 17 - The Star, your Life Path Number will be 8 - Strength

__EXCEPTION to the rules__

When calculating your __BIRTH CARD NUMBER__ and your result equals 19, you will have three special cards: __one Life Path card:__ 19 - The Sun, and __two birth cards:__ 1 - the Magician, 10 - The Wheel of Fortune.

Feel free to use this code in your own projects.
Enjoy!
